# Hey, I'm Nycrite.
I'm a UI designer and programmer that is based nowhere else but the United States. I like to do my regular hobbies of computer programming and UI design in my spare time, and I have a lot of that spare time, so that's how I became really attached with it.

Most of what I do is open-sourced, so feel free to contribute by opening pull requests, notifing me of bugs and issues, and suggesting some awesome ideas!
